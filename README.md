# Vite RiotJS Template

Use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) Starter Template to scaffold a new [Riot](https://riot.js.org/) project.

## Getting Started

Pull the template files with [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) and install dependencies

```
npx degit n2geoff/vite-riot-template my-project

cd my-project
npm install
npm run dev

## NPM Scripts

- npm run dev - Starts the development server at port 3000
- npm run build - Builds the application in a dist folder
- npm run preview - Serves the build files (dist folder) locally at port 5000

> Note that if after this last command you do not see anything, you can use instead this other command:

`npm run preview --host` - You should then be able to see your files locally at port 5000
